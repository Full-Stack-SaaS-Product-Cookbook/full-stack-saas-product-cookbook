# Full Stack SaaS Product Cookbook
## From Soup üçú to Nuts ü•ú - Create a Profitable SaaS Product as a Solo Developer

### Book

The _Full Stack SaaS Product Cookbook_ book source!

### Cover

Because I just don't want to fight LaTeX, the cover is a completely seperate latex file to the rest of the book. It can be merged with the actual book PDF if needed. Obviously for a physical copy it can be uploaded as the suggest cover art at places like amazon if a physical copy is to be printed
